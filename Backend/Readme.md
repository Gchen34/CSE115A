# Backend
The backend consists of two API servers.

## PisaSearchAPI
An API server that interacts with UCSC's Pisa course website. It is used for retrieving class information. 

## WebEndpoints
The API server that website users directly interact with. It will handle retrieving user data, tutoring information, and other information from our database.
